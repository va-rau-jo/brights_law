Brightâ€™s Law by Reduction

All possible permutations of 3 integers can be reduced to all possible permutations of 3 positive digits: 1000

Begin reducing the number based on rules:

 Contains at least one 0: 729
 Contains at least one 5: 512
 Contains at least one repeated digit: 336
 Not in ascending order: 56
 Two digits add to get 10: 32
 Three digits add to get 10: 30
 Three digits add to get 20: 28
 Subtract two lowest digits from highest digit to get 0: 22
 Add two digits to get 5, last digit is even: 18
 Add two digits to get 15, last digit is even: 14
 Subtract two digits to get 5, last digit is even: 6
 Add highest two digits and subtract lowest digit to get 10: 0
